Implementation and testing of Hirschberg’s Algorithm

==================================
Usage
give make in top level folder. Binaries will be generated in bin folder. THe important binaries are:
1. hirschberg_edit: Calculates hirschberg alignment of two string. takes two files and outputs a new file output.txt
ex. ./hirschberg_edit in1.txt in2.txt
2. naive_edit: Calculates  alignment of two string using Wagner–Fischer algorithm. takes two files and outputs a new file outputNaive.txt
ex. ./naive_edit in1.txt in2.txt
==================================
Code Layout

The source code file resides in src folder. It has two files:
1.basic_ed.cpp: basic edit distance which O(mn) both space and time
2.generate_string.cpp : a string generator to generator good artificial strings
3.main_ha.cpp : hirschbergs algorithm which is O(mn) time but O(n) space.
==================================
Scripts

The scripts are organized into three folders
1. Test: this has basic tests which compares the edit aligned string found out by hirschberg with the ED given by naive algorithm.
test1.sh: Test basic string "A" with "B"
test2.sh: Test empty string with a non empty string like "AAAAAAAA"  with ""
test3.sh: Test "telephone" with "elephant"
test4.sh: Test unary string with A's
test5.sh: take a big random string and compute its edit distance with another big random string

2. profile: THis folder has scripts which were used to draw various plots presented in the presentation
2a. n*m vs time and memory
2b. ED vs time and memory
2c. sigma vs time and memory

3. dataset: This has scripts to test real world test scripts.
3a. dna dataset
