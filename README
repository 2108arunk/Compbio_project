Scripts

The scripts are organized into three folders
1. Test: this has basic tests which compares the edit aligned string found out by hirschberg with the ED given by naive algorithm.
test1.sh: Test basic string "A" with "B"
test2.sh: Test empty string with a non empty string like "AAAAAAAA"  with ""
test3.sh: Test "telephone" with "elephant"
test4.sh: Test unary string with A's
test5.sh: take a big random string and compute its edit distance with another big random string
